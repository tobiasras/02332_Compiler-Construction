## How to use Makefile:
* Run ``make`` to build the project and parse all files in the examples folder.
* Run ``make example{1-5}`` to build the project and parse one of the files in the examples folder. Example: ``make example3``
* Run ``make clean`` to delete all build files (.java,.class,.tokens, etc.)
